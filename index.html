    <h2> The History of Origami</h2>
    <p> Origami is an ancient art form of folding paper into a desired shape, translating to Ori (folded), kami (paper): folded paper. Despite what you may think, origami did not originate from Japan, instead, origami originated from China, and was brought to Japan in the 6th century. Origami was used in Japan to decorate temples and shrines, which is what led to the popularisation of origami. Origami was first made in (approximately) 100 CE, just after China invented paper.
