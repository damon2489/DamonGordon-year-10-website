  <p> Origami can take hours upon hours of work for extremely complex models, and requires lots of patience, but it serves as a boredom killer, and as relaxation. Origami makes beautiful models, which you can display, serving as a visible achievement of yours. Origami can decorate spaces, and is even used in space, outside of earth, in engineering applications, as well as on earth engineering applications. </p>
